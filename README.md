BlinkIt Sales Analysis
🚀 Just wrapped up an in-depth Tableau Dashboard titled "BlinkIt Sales Analysis"!

As part of a hands-on data visualization initiative, I analyzed various operational and customer-facing datasets from BlinkIt, a fast-paced quick commerce company, to uncover insights across sales, inventory, delivery, marketing, and feedback.
